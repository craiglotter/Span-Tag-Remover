Span Tag Remover
================

When you copy and paste from a Microsoft Word document or any other styled document to Microsoft Frontpage, the necessary HTML code is generated for you. However, Microsoft Frontpage introduces a number of special '<span>' tags and 'class=...' style info in the HTML, code that is only relevant to Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. This means that these pages don't display very well (or at all) in other standard web browsers.

Span Tag Remover 1.0 is a quick and dirty tool that simply removes all these foreign tags from the HTML code.
